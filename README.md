<p id="description">The Project Assignment Module is a web application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) that enables candidates to view, accept, and track assigned projects. It includes features like progress tracking, task completion scoring, and the ability to manage project assignments dynamically.

This project is perfect for managing and monitoring project assignments for candidates in a professional or educational setting, allowing both candidates and administrators to track progress and evaluate performance.</p>
